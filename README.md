## Welcome to 8GitHub!
- Curious what I'm working on?
  - A modpack for "Risk of Rain 2" called "Console Overhaul", a utility modpack for modders and server administrators.
      - Adds an auto-complete function that uses the 'tab' key instead of the :arrow_down: key, called "B.A.C."
      - A "Multi-User Targeting" system; which fetches a list of all players that matches a query, called "M.U.T."
      - A binding system; allowing toggle or 'simultaneous' commands to be bound to keys.
      - And includes a playerStats API; which allows you to fetch almost any statistic attached to a characterBody with nothing but a string, called "T.M.I."!

- What's next?
  - A game, or two.
  - A liquid displacement/ripple algorithm.
  - A raytracing lighting engine for 2D games.
  - Something secret. :shushing_face:
     
I also have a [gitlab](https://gitlab.com/8bit_shadow) page too!
